## Intro

<details>
  <summary>2016 was a pivotal year for me.</summary>

  For the past four years, I  had been traveling the world and studying coral reefs from every region. I was becoming an expert on their evolution and their interactions with various microbes. I knew these ecosystems had been in decline for decades, that climate change was a major threat, and that some people had claimed that eating meat and flying in airplanes were major contributors to climate change. But I also knew there were other threats - other reasons corals had been in decline, like infectious diseases and overdevelopment. I also knew that my individual choice to scale back on meat or flying would have zero impact on the survival of even a single coral colony. As I flew back and forth across the globe, I made no effort to change the meat-centric diet that formed a large part of my cultural inheritance. I felt like my personal physiology was acclimated to meat in every meal, and that I could better direct my conservation efforts toward my science. 

  And then there was 2016.

  Unusual heat spread across the globe. Starting in the Southern Hemisphere, corals began to bleach on a massive scale. In many places, they didn't die from prolonged bleaching, but from acute heat stress - something that was previously unheard of at the scale we were witnessing. I began to hear first-hand reports of devastation from places like Lizard Island, Australia, whose reefs I had become intimately familiar with in 2014. My friends and colleagues were watching as entire reef communities died in real-time. This was unprecedented in recorded history, and many of the most impacted reefs were remote, and far from the influence of all the other threats we had been studying. Climate change was suddently causing unimaginable destruction over the span of just months - not decades. Although other threats were (are) still a major problem, their magnitude paled in comparison to that of rising temperatures.

That year, it became clear that if we didn't solve climate change, literally nothing else would matter, when it came to coral reefs.

I think it was a message to the coral scientist list-serve, Coral List, that nudged me to reconsider vegetarianism. Among the carnage of that year, people in the field were looking for ways to **do** something. I decided that one thing I could do was reduce my meat consumption. And now, 7 years later (and counting), avoiding meat is still something that I feel is important. Many other changes to my lifestyle and philosophy were set in motion that year, but those may be for another blog post.

For this one, I'll go over the details of my plant-based philosophy. I hope to edit this if my views change over time and if I find resources that influence my thinking or help to explain it. I don't plan to hide any changes - anything I don't write explicitly will be available by comparing commits of this blog post on GitHub.

## Do individual choices matter?

They do when they have clear moral and ethical implications. They do when you're a leader and an authority.

## How does meat-eating affect climate change?
