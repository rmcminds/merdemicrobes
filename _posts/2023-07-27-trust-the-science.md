Trust *the* science?

Trust the scien*tists*?

Trust {the |}scien{ce|tists}!

Ahh. That's safe.

Wait, what science? Or which scientists? 

The majority? Who did the counting? How do I trust the people who tell me what the majority is? Does the majority include scientists who are experts in the wrong topic?

What if everything the biologists say is true - but they're not experts in how their field interacts with economics, social science, law, or policy?

It's very frustrating to have knowledge that could make an impact on the world, yet not be listened to.
