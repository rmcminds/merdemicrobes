rmcminds: biologist, data scientist, wheel inventor

I biologize, philosophize, and computize. I’ve always been drawn to the more theoretical aspects of evolutionary biology, which has led to my recent focus on statistics and modeling. Unfortunately, I’m bad at math and hate being inside all the time, so I’m always looking for excuses to observe nature directly.
