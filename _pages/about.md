$whoami

rmcminds: biologist, data scientist, wheel inventor

I biologize, philosophize, and computize. I’ve always been drawn to the more theoretical aspects of evolutionary biology, which has led to my recent focus on statistics and modeling. Unfortunately, I’m bad at math and hate being inside all the time, so I’m always looking for excuses to observe nature directly.

I have created both this site and [The Cnidae Gritty](https://thecnidaegritty.org) partly because I couldn't decide which pun I preferred, and partly because they have slightly different purposes. I plan to keep this site entirely to myself, while The Cnidae Gritty will hopefully have a lot of blog posts by other collaborators, such as students of mine. I also plan to focus more on personal projects here, like unfinished Shiny apps, blogs with personal updates and personal opinions that are a bit less filtered than the educationally-focused pages and posts over at The Cnidae Gritty.
